* org-mode export

This is how I want it to work:

- Create new post as usual =rake new_post["Blog post title"]=
  - This creates an org-file instead of markdown
  - Edit the org-file

- Run an export command via the usual menu =C-c C-e=
  - org-file is converted to markdown and saved to same name and location with .md suffix
  - optionally allow reviewing and editing the exported buffer before saving
    - or just ask after saving "Edit the exported file? (y/n)"

- Run =rake generate= as usual

- Publish as usual

*** TODO Have =rake new_post= create a good org-file
*** TODO Have =rake generate/publish etc= not publish org-files
*** DONE Put octopress-export in org-mode export menu
*** DONE Remove =new_post= etc from octorgopress.el
*** TODO Have export function force saving current document
*** TODO Have export function figure out the new filename (.md)
    check how twbs does it
*** TODO Have export function save buffer to the new filename
    check how twbs does it
